# Prop Firm Industry in Crisis: 2024-2025 Market Intelligence Report

The proprietary trading firm industry experienced its most turbulent period in 2024-2025, with **80-100 prop firms shutting down** (13-14% of all firms) following MetaQuotes' February 2024 platform crackdown. The landmark MyForexFunds case collapsed spectacularly when a Special Master recommended **dismissal with prejudice** after finding CFTC misconduct, while FTMO consolidated dominance with a **$250 million acquisition of OANDA**. The industry is now valued at approximately **$20 billion**, but regulatory uncertainty across the EU, UK, and US creates significant opportunities for transparency-focused solutions like VCP.

## Prop firm failures reached unprecedented levels in 2024

The catalyst for the industry's crisis was MetaQuotes' decision in February 2024 to revoke MT4/MT5 licenses from prop firms serving US clients or operating without proper broker relationships. This single action triggered a cascade of failures.

**True Forex Funds** collapsed first, losing its MetaQuotes license on February 2, 2024, and permanently shutting down on **May 13, 2024** due to financial insolvency. Approximately **300 traders** were left with **$1.2 million** in outstanding payouts. CEO Richard Nagy called the termination reason "nonsense."

**SurgeTrader** (Naples, Florida) followed on **May 24, 2024**, after losing both MetaQuotes and Match-Trader platform access within three months. The firm cited an "unwarranted" termination by Match-Trade Technologies. Notably, CEO Jana Seaman's husband Brent Seaman was charged by the SEC with orchestrating a **$35 million Ponzi scheme** between 2019-2022.

**The Funded Trader** paused all operations on **March 28, 2024**, admitting to **$2 million+ in denied payouts** during a CEO livestream. The firm later announced partial recovery, claiming 30% of outstanding payouts processed by August 2024, but Trustpilot reviews (2.5 stars) show continued complaints. The parent company reportedly restructured and moved to the **Cayman Islands**.

**Smart Prop Trader** (CEO Blake Olson) announced closure on **November 27, 2024**, with final operations ending December 29, 2024. Other casualties included Funded Engineer (bankruptcy), Karma Prop Traders (closed after two months), Ascetic Capital (one week), and Fidelcrest (March 4, 2024).

## MyForexFunds case ends in regulatory embarrassment

The CFTC's August 2023 fraud charges against Traders Global Group Inc. (MyForexFunds) and CEO Murtuza Kazmi—alleging **$310 million** in customer fees from **135,000+ traders**—represented the most significant regulatory action against prop trading. The case has now completely reversed.

On **May 13, 2025**, Special Master Jose L. Linares issued a Report and Recommendation advising **dismissal of the CFTC's complaint with prejudice**. The Special Master found that CFTC attorneys exhibited "willful" and "bad faith" conduct, including misrepresenting a CAD $31.5 million payment to Canadian tax authorities as potential asset dissipation—despite knowing the truth at least one week before filing for the asset freeze.

Commissioner Caroline Pham publicly criticized her own agency in July 2024, stating: "This is a grave matter, and we, the Commission, will be subject to intense scrutiny over how we handle the alleged CFTC misconduct." Lead attorney Ashley Burden admitted to being "careless and sloppy" during investigation.

Four CFTC lawyers and one investigator were placed on **administrative leave** for potential violations of professional ethics. The CFTC was ordered to pay MyForexFunds' legal fees. On October 6, 2025, MyForexFunds posted on social media: "Be patient, we missed you"—signaling a potential operational comeback.

## MetaQuotes crackdown reshaped the technology landscape

MetaQuotes' February 2024 decision to restrict MT4/MT5 licenses fundamentally transformed prop trading infrastructure. The company cited US regulatory exposure, "scam prop firm activities," and grey-labeling abuse as primary drivers. New requirements mandate that prop firms prove **licensed broker status** with a bank reference letter from a brick-and-mortar institution.

Market share data shows MetaTrader dropped from **48% to 24%** among prop firms within nine months. The beneficiaries were:

- **Match-Trader** (Match-Trade Technologies): **290% increase** in server clients since January 2024; **60+ prop firms** onboarded; **60% of top 10 prop firms** now use the platform; won Best FX Trading Platform Award at Finance Magnates London Summit 2024
- **cTrader** (Spotware): Adopted by 12+ verified prop firms including FTMO, The5ers, FundedNext, and Funding Pips; offers 5-day onboarding and actively courts prop firm business
- **DXtrade** (Devexperts): Added 40+ challenge-based prop firms in one year; used by FTMO for initial US client migration
- **TradeLocker**: 75+ prop firms onboarded; 150,000+ traders monthly

Broker withdrawals accelerated the crisis. **Eightcap** halted services to prop firms at end of February 2024. **Purple Trading** terminated multiple clients on February 11-12, 2024, affecting Funded Engineer, AquaFunded, Goat Funded Trader, The Funded Trader, and Skilled Funded Traders. **Blackbull Markets** cut off Funding Pips on February 14, 2024.

## FTMO dominates while regulatory scrutiny intensifies across jurisdictions

FTMO emerged as the undisputed industry leader, generating **$329 million revenue** in 2024 (53% YoY increase) with **$62.5 million net profit**. The Czech firm holds **2.3 million+ trading accounts** and maintains a 4.8/5 Trustpilot rating across 32,233 reviews.

The January 2025 announcement of FTMO's **acquisition of OANDA**—backed by a **$250 million credit line** from Czech banks led by UniCredit—marks a historic expansion of a prop firm into regulated brokerage. FTMO is now the only prop firm offering MT5 in the US through this partnership, though five states remain excluded (Arkansas, Delaware, Louisiana, Montana, South Carolina).

**EU regulatory developments** are creating compliance pressure:

- The **EU AI Act** (entered force August 1, 2024) explicitly mentions algorithmic trading systems; high-risk AI obligations take effect August 2, 2026, with penalties up to **€35 million or 7% of global turnover**
- **MiFID III/MiFIR II** published March 8, 2024, with transposition deadline September 29, 2025; RTS 27/28 best execution reporting has been eliminated (reducing burden), but PFOF ban takes effect June 2026
- ESMA is conducting **preliminary inspections** of funded trader firms and collecting data through consultations
- **Czech National Bank** became first EU regulator to publicly state prop trading "may be subject to MiFID" depending on business model

Individual country warnings emerged from CONSOB (Italy), FSMA (Belgium), and CNMV (Spain), all raising concerns about prop firms as "shadow investment games" or "finance video games."

**UK FCA** launched criminal prosecution of **9 individuals** linked to illegal forex trading schemes (first prosecution against forex influencers), with trials scheduled for February and March 2027. The FCA added 10 new unauthorized forex brokers to warning lists on January 21, 2025 alone.

**US regulatory landscape** shifted dramatically with Acting CFTC Chairman Caroline Pham's February 2025 reorganization into two task forces, explicitly aiming to "stop regulation by enforcement." FY2024 enforcement saw a record **$17.1 billion** in total monetary relief, primarily from FTX/Alameda ($12.7 billion) and Binance ($2.7 billion), but only 11 fraud cases (down from 59 in FY2023).

## Industry consolidation accelerates with broker-backed models emerging

The estimated **$20 billion market** has experienced 1,264% expansion between December 2015 and April 2024. Search interest for "prop firm" increased **526% in the USA** from 2020-2024, reaching an all-time high of 49,500 monthly global searches in Q2 2025.

Geographic distribution shows **62% of firms** headquartered in the United States, with significant concentrations in UAE/Dubai (10 firms) and UK (7 firms). An Acuiti survey found **8% of prop firms have already moved out of EU**, 12% have decided to move, and 36% are considering relocation—primarily to Dubai and Singapore. Key drivers include DORA compliance burden and the "punitive" IFR/IFD capital regime.

**Broker-backed prop trading** represents the major new business model:

- OANDA (early mover, now owned by FTMO)
- Axi Select
- IC Markets (IC Funded, launched March 2024)
- ThinkMarkets (ThinkCapital, 2024)
- Blueberry Markets (Blueberry Funded)
- Hantec Markets (Hantec Trader)

Challenge pass rate data reveals only **7% of traders** receive payouts from the 14% who pass challenges initially (FPFX data from 300,000 sampled accounts). Average trader investment dropped **50%** in 2024, and **60% of prop firm clients lose funds** (averaging $4,300 invested).

**Crypto prop firms** are expanding rapidly: HyroTrader offers real Bybit trading with $2M+ payouts processed; BrightFunded provides 40+ crypto pairs with up to 100% profit splits; Crypto Fund Trader offers 715+ crypto pairs from Switzerland.

## Trust deficits create opportunity for verification solutions

CFTC prop firm scam complaints increased **74% YoY** in 2024. Common complaint patterns include payout denials with retroactively applied rules, slippage manipulation through execution software, hidden fees, profitable account terminations, and mid-challenge rule changes.

**Current Trustpilot scores** (November 2025):
- FTMO: 4.6/5 (32,233 reviews)
- Topstep: 4.6/5
- The Funded Trader: 2.5/5
- Blueberry Funded: 4.1/5 (2,000+ reviews)

**Blacklisted firms** include Crypto Fund Trader (backdating rules to deny payouts), Fidelcrest (unjustified terminations), and BluFX (vague violation enforcement).

Industry initiatives remain nascent. **The Prop Association** was founded in 2025 with Blueberry Funded as a founding member. Third-party verification services like PropSafe, VettedPropFirms, and TheTrustedProp have emerged but lack standardized protocols. The CFTC RED List now contains **240+ foreign entities**, including True Forex Funds (added June 2023).

Warning signs for traders include offshore-only registration (St. Vincent, Seychelles), hidden leadership, changing rules, delayed payouts, and lack of regulated broker partnerships. France's AMF/ACPR added 50 new unauthorized platforms to their blacklist in 2024 (24 forex, 26 crypto derivatives).

## Conclusion: Strategic implications for VCP adoption

The 2024-2025 prop firm crisis created a perfect storm of platform instability, regulatory uncertainty, and trust deficits. Key opportunities for VCP include:

**Immediate targets** are the surviving major prop firms seeking differentiation: FTMO's OANDA integration, FundedNext, The5ers, Funding Pips, and the emerging broker-backed programs (IC Funded, ThinkCapital, Blueberry Funded) all need transparent verification mechanisms to rebuild industry trust.

**Platform providers** represent infrastructure-level adoption potential: Match-Trade Technologies (60+ prop firms), Spotware/cTrader (12+ verified firms), and TradeLocker (75+ firms) could integrate VCP at the platform level, reaching thousands of firms simultaneously.

**Regulatory tailwinds** favor transparency solutions: ESMA's active investigation of prop firms, the EU AI Act's requirements for algorithmic trading transparency, and the CFTC's embarrassing MyForexFunds dismissal all create demand for independently verifiable trade execution and payout records.

**Geographic priorities** should focus on the UAE/Dubai hub (business-friendly, growing concentration of relocated firms), Czech Republic (FTMO headquarters, CNB engaged on regulation), and UK (FCA actively prosecuting bad actors, creating compliance demand).

The MyForexFunds dismissal demonstrates that even regulatory enforcement depends on verifiable evidence—a core VCP value proposition. With 74% more scam complaints and only 7% of traders receiving payouts, the industry's credibility crisis demands the kind of immutable, transparent verification that blockchain-based protocols uniquely provide.
